<h1>Information Technology</h1><br><br><br>
<p>In the world of technology, the human life will be incomplete without the role of Information Technology. Information Technology at BIT is interdisciplinary. 
It was inaugurated in the year 1999. Here we empower students with the tools and ideas that can be applied anywhere both in college and beyond. 
We aim at molding the students into highly qualified technocrats and to make them good citizens of our nation to serve the industry and society. The B.Tech. Information Technology programme has been accredited by NBA. 
The department has a heartfelt team of dedicated faculty members with a sound knowledge in various areas and it has the state-of-art facilities for various laboratories and supports smart class learning.</p>
